# Entangled Chat

**Entangled Chat** is a communication protocol that transcends traditional addressing. Instead of sending messages to an IP address or a username, you broadcast thoughts that resonate with specific semantic frequencies.

## Core Concepts

### Prime Entanglement
Based on `tinyaleph/core/entanglement.js`, this plugin maintains a local `PrimeEntanglementGraph`.
- **Nodes**: Users/Agents represented by Prime Identity Keys.
- **Edges**: "Entanglement" strength, built through shared context and interaction history.

### Resonance Routing
Messages are not routed by address tables but by **Semantic Resonance**.
1.  Message content is embedded into a high-dimensional vector (using `resolang`'s `smf` logic).
2.  The vector is broadcast to the mesh.
3.  Only nodes whose "Phase Alignment" exceeds a threshold can decrypt and receive the message.

### Non-Local Groups
Groups are formed dynamically by **Coherence Clusters**.
- A "Physics Group" isn't a list of members.
- It's a standing wave pattern in the network.
- Anyone who tunes their node to the "Physics" frequency (by engaging with that content) becomes part of the group.

## Features

- **Instant P2P**: Direct WebRTC connections established via entanglement handshakes.
- **Group Mind**: Chat rooms that form and dissolve based on topic coherence.
- **Quantum Security**: Messages encrypted with `resolang`'s post-quantum KeyTriplets.

## Usage

1.  **Tune In**: Set your node's "Focus" (e.g., "AI", "Ethics", "Coding").
2.  **Broadcast**: Type a message. It will reach everyone currently entangled with those topics.
3.  **Entangle**: Click on a user to initiate a direct, high-bandwidth entanglement link.
